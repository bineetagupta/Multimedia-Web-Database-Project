Build/execution instructions:

Task 1:
Change directory to the Code folder and then execute the following command from the command line 
Template: matlab /minimize /nosplash /nodesktop /r Task1(<r>,<n>,<dir_path>)
Example: matlab /minimize /nosplash /nodesktop /r Task1(4,10,'C:\Users\Neha\GoogleDrive\ASU\CSE515\Projects\Phase1\DataR\')
Task 2:
Change directory to the Code\Task2 folder, it has a code file Task2.m and then execute the following command from the command line 
Template: matlab /minimize /nosplash /nodesktop /r Task2(4,'C:\Users\Neha\GoogleDrive\ASU\CSE515\Projects\Phase1\DataR\')
Example: matlab /minimize /nosplash /nodesktop /r Task2(<r>,<dir_path>)
Task 3:
To build the source, open the solution extracted from Code\Task3\MotionVector.zip. Copy the MotionVector.exe built, from the Debug Folder of the project to the Code\Task3 folder. I have provided a built version in the Code/Task3 folder as well.
At the command line, change directory to the Code\Task3 folder-it has a batch script Task3.bat. Execute the following command from the command line: 
Template: Task3.bat <r> <dir_path>
Example: Task3.bat 4 C:\Users\Neha\GoogleDrive\ASU\CSE515\Projects\Phase1\DataR\
