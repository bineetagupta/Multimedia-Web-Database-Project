1. Matlab code invokes binaries for each of the histogram related tasks, a zip file has been created with the code to build to the required binaries for that task.
2. Open this source files (main.cpp, parser.h) in your IDE/Notepad of your choice which supports gcc with c++11 support like code blocks for windows or on linux the console can be used to compile the code with the provided makefile.
3. Build the project. On Windows, the binaries would be generated named as <project_name>.exe for windows.
On linux, the binaries would be generated by the name of parser.
NOTE: The name of the binary should match the name of the zip file from which the corresponding code was extracted.
4. Place all the generated binaries in the root folder of your matlab task files.
